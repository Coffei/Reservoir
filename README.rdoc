== Welcome to Reservoir
Reservoir is simple web application to manage room reservations.

== How to deploy
Currently, Reservoir is using JRuby and can be deployed on JBoss (or any other 
JavaEE container). First ensure you have JRuby installed (the version should support Ruby 1.9 syntax).
Then just follow these few steps:
1. Setup your database:
       Currently, Reservoir is configured to use Postgresql. If you want to use othe
       DBMS you need to make some additional changes (if not follow step 1.2):
       1.1. Replace jdbcpostgresql adapter in GEMFILE with proper adapters for the
       DB of your choice.
       1.2. Ensure your DB is running and is accessible from the machine where Reservoir
       is about to be deployed.
       1.3. Configure your DB in reservoir by editing config/database.yml file. 
              (See rails tutorials for further instruction). By default it is using postgres
              database named "reservoir" on localhost with username and password "reservoir".
2. Setup Reservoir:
       2.1. Run "bundle install" in the Reservoir dir.
       2.2. Run "bundle exec rake assets:precompile
              Note: This command might take a while (you can run it with --trace to see the progress)
       2.3 Package Reservoir to war file by command "warble war".
3. Deploy:
       You can now deploy the generated war file to your JavaEE container.
